# arduino_eye_alarm
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately detect sleepy driving and make alarms accordingly, which aims to prevent the drivers from drowsy driving and create a safer driving environment. 
The project was accomplished by a Webcam that constantly takes image of driver, a beagle board that implement image processing algorithm of sleepy detection, and a feedback circuit that could generate alarm and a power supply system.
